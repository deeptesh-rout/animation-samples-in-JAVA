Introduction
------------

Sample demonstrating circular reveal effect. Reveal animations can be used to
provide visual continuity when showing or hiding views. With
[ViewAnimationsUtils.createCircularReveal()][1] you can use the startRadius and
endRadius to define a hiding or revealing animation. You can also define the
center of the animation, in this sample the center is x=0, y=0 which defines
the top left of the View as the center.

Press the *Reveal* button to see the the circular reveal.
